Here's a technical document describing our role-based view implementation:

# Role-Based View Implementation
Technical documentation for the role-based view system in sparQ.

## Architecture Overview
The application implements role-based views through a layered approach combining decorators, templates, and controller logic.

### Core Components

#### 1. Access Control Decorator

```python
modules/core/decorators.py

from functools import wraps
from flask import abort
from flask_login import current_user

def admin_required(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
        if not current_user.is_admin:
            abort(403)
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorated_function
```

#### 2. Route Protection
Routes are protected at the controller level using decorators:

##### Admin-only routes
```python
@blueprint.route("/employees/new")
@login_required
@admin_required
def new_employee():
"""Only admins can create new employees"""
...
```

##### Shared routes with role-based views
```python
@blueprint.route("/employees/<int:employee_id>")
@login_required
def employee_detail(employee_id):
    """Both admins and employees can view, but see different templates"""
    is_admin = current_user.is_admin
    is_self = current_user.id == employee.user_id
    
    if not is_admin and not is_self:
    return render_template("employees/employee-view/details.html", ...)
    return render_template("employees/admin-view/details.html", ...)
```

#### 3. Template Structure
```
modules/people/views/templates/employees/
├── admin-view/
│ └── details.html # Full administrative view
└── employee-view/
└── details.html # Limited employee view
```

### Access Control Strategy

#### Administrative Functions
- Protected by @admin_required decorator
- Only accessible to users with is_admin=True
- Includes: create, edit, delete operations

#### Shared Views
- Accessible to all authenticated users
- Template selection based on user role
- Different information visibility per role

#### Self-Service
- Users can view their own full profile
- Limited view of other employees' profiles
- Controlled through controller logic

### Implementation Benefits
1. Clear separation of admin and employee interfaces
2. Security enforced at multiple levels
3. Maintainable template structure
4. Easy to extend for new roles
5. Clean user experience for each role

### Current Limitations
1. Some code duplication in templates
2. Need to maintain parallel template structures
3. Must remember to apply decorators consistently

### Future Improvements
1. Consider template inheritance for shared layouts
2. Implement role-based menu systems
3. Add more granular permission controls
4. Create view-specific CSS files
