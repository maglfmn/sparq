# Employee View Implementation

## Core Sections for Employee View
- Personal Dashboard
- Profile overview (name, position, department)
- Quick contact info for their manager
- Important announcements/notifications
- Quick actions (request time off, submit expense, etc.)

## My Profile
- View their own details
- Limited edit capabilities (phone, emergency contacts, address)
- Password change
- Can view but not edit sensitive info (salary, position, etc.)

## Time & Attendance
- View work schedule
- Request time off
- View time off balance
- View attendance history

## Team View (Limited)
- See their immediate team members
- Basic info only (name, position, work contact)
- No access to other employees' sensitive information

## Documents
- Access to their own documents
- Company policies
- Employee handbook
- Forms they need to fill

## Key Differences from Admin View
- No access to other employees' sensitive data
- Can't modify organizational structure
- No access to salary information of others
- Limited editing capabilities of their own profile
- No delete/create capabilities

### Mobile-First Considerations:
- Large touch targets for buttons
- Simplified navigation (bottom nav bar for mobile)
- Collapsible sections
- Minimal data entry requirements
- Quick actions accessible from dashboard
